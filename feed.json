You can choose differents templates and customize them with differents colors or fonts. Some of them are free, other can be used only with an upgraded account.</p>\n<p>Upgraded account brings more templates and more customization. You still can try all these option to your free account but you will not be able to download your resume. </p>\n<p>All your changes are automatically saved and you can download your resume in PDF. </p>\n<p>It is easy! You should try it !</p>",
