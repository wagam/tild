                <p>For continuous integration puropses, I need to be sure some of my commits are all done together. If some fail for some reasons, I have to reconciliate everything t o be sure it is ok. After some research, I found a git command that helped me a lot: </p>
<pre><code class="language-ShellSession">git push --atomic origin branch1 branch2 ...<br></code></pre>
<p> The idea with this command is to have only one commit doing multiple things. It can help to merge, tag and add a note in a single command for example. </p>
<p>For more informations, you can read this <a href="https://github.blog/2015-04-30-git-2-4-atomic-pushes-push-to-deploy-and-more/">github</a> article. </p>

<p>The website is very user friendly and I created my resume in less than an hour with a good result. You can choose differents templates and customize them with differents colors or fonts. Some of them are free, other can be used only with an upgraded account.</p>
<p>Upgraded account brings more templates and more customization. You still can try all these option to your free account but you will not be able to download your resume. </p>
<p>All your changes are automatically saved and you can download your resume in PDF. </p>
<p>It is easy! You should try it !</p>
