                <p>I needed to recreate a resume and I didn't want to do it with MS Word or with Latex as I did before. As a web developer, i was almost sure some web resources exist. After googling for few minutes, I discovered <a href="https://novoresume.com/">Novo Resume</a> .</p>
<p>The website is very user friendly and I created my resume in less than an hour with a good result. You can choose differents templates and customize them with differents colors or fonts. Some of them are free, other can be used only with an upgraded account.</p>
<p>Upgraded account brings more templates and more customization. You still can try all these option to your free account but you will not be able to download your resume. </p>
<p>All your changes are automatically saved and you can download your resume in PDF. </p>
<p>It is easy! You should try it !</p>
